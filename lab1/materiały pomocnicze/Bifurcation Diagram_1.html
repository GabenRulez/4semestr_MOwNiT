<h2>Bifurcation Diagram</h2>
So, again, what is a <i>bifurcation</i>? A bifucation is a 
period-doubling, a change from an N-point attractor to a 2N-point 
attractor, which occurs when the control parameter is changed.<br>
A Bifurcation <i>Diagram</i> is a visual summary of the succession of 
period-doubling produced as r increases. The next figure shows the 
bifurcation diagram of the logistic map, r along the x-axis. For each 
value of r the system is first allowed to settle down and then the 
successive values of x are plotted for a few hundred iterations.

We see that for r less than one, all the points are plotted at zero. 
Zero is the one point attractor for r less than one. For r between 1 and
 3, we still have one-point attractors, but the 'attracted' value of x 
increases as r increases, at least to r=3. Bifurcations occur at r=3, 
r=3.45, 3.54, 3.564, 3.569 (approximately), etc., until just beyond 
3.57, where the system is chaotic.   <br>

However, the system is not chaotic for all values of r greater than 3.57. <br>
Let's zoom in a bit.

Notice that at several values of r, greater than 3.57, a small number of
 x=values are visited. These regions produce the 'white space' in the 
diagram. Look closely at r=3.83 and you will see a three-point 
attractor.<br>
In fact, between 3.57 and 4 there is a rich interleaving of chaos and 
order. A small change in r can make a stable system  chaotic, and vice 
versa.<br>
