<h2>Sensitivity to initial conditions</h2>
Another important feature emerges in the chaotic region ...<br>
To see it, we set r=3.99 and begin at x<sub>1</sub>=.3. The next graph shows the time series for 48 iterations of the logistic map.

Now, suppose we alter the starting point a bit. The next figure compares the time series for x<sub>1</sub>=.3 (in black) with that for x<sub>1</sub>=.301 (in blue).

<center><i> Two time series for r=3.99, x<sub>1</sub>=.3 compared to 
x<sub>1</sub>=.301</i></center>
The two time series stay close together for about 10 iterations. But after that, they are pretty much on their own.<br>
Let's try starting closer together. We next compare starting at .3 with starting at .3000001...

<center><i> Two time series for r=3.99, x<sub>1</sub>=.3 compared to 
x<sub>1</sub>=.3000001</i></center>
This time they stay close for a longer time, but after 24 iterations 
they diverge. To see just how independent they become, the next figure 
provides scatterplots for the two series before and after 24 iterations.

<br>
The correlation after 24 iterations (right side), is essentially zero. Unreliability has replaced reliability.<p>

We have illustrated here one of the symptoms of chaos. A chaotic system is one for which <i>the distance between two trajectories from nearby points in its state space diverge over time</i>. The magnitude of the divergence increases <i>exponentially</i> in a chaotic system.</p><p>

So what? Well, it means that a chaotic system, even one determined by a 
simple rule, is in principle unpredictable. Say what? It is 
unpredictable, "in principle" because in order to predict its behavior  
into the future we must know its currrent value <em>precisely</em>. We 
have here an example where a slight difference, in the sixth decimal 
place, resulted in prediction failure after 24 iterations. And six 
decimal places far exceeds the kind of measuring accuracy we typically 
achieve with natural biological systems.</p><p>
